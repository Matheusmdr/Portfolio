            I&apos;m a software engineer based in Toronto, Canada and also a
            communication and journalism student. I enjoy creating things that
            live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or
            anything in between. I have been freelancing for a year now while
            studying at the university and I&apos;ve manage to gain a decent
            amount of experience and valuable knowledge from all different kinds
            of fields throughout my projects/work.
